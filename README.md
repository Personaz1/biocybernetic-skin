# Biocybernetic Nanoneural Skin

This repository contains the research, design, and development efforts for the Biocybernetic Nanoneural Skin project.

## Overview

Biocybernetic Nanoneural Skin is an adaptive, multilayered second-skin platform originally conceived to protect and treat neonates with epidermolysis bullosa (EB) and congenital ichthyosis. It integrates established materials with a long-term research vision of programmable nanorobots forming a distributed neuromorphic network.

For a detailed understanding of the project's vision, goals, architecture, and roadmap, please refer to the [Whitepaper](whitepaper.md).
