# Biocybernetic Nanoneural Skin

This repository contains the research, design, and development efforts for the Biocybernetic Nanoneural Skin project.

## Overview

Biocybernetic Nanoneural Skin is an adaptive, multilayered second-skin platform originally conceived to protect and treat neonates with epidermolysis bullosa (EB) and congenital ichthyosis. It integrates established materials with a long-term research vision of programmable nanorobots forming a distributed neuromorphic network.

For a detailed understanding of the project's vision, goals, and roadmap, please refer to the [Whitepaper](whitepaper.md).
For a detailed system architecture, see [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md).

*(Note: Some directories and files, like `LICENSE` or specific files in `docs/`, `src/`, etc., will be created as the project progresses.)*

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Personaz1/biocybernetic-skin.git
    cd biocybernetic-skin
    ```
2.  **Review the Key Documents**:
    *   Start with the [Whitepaper](whitepaper.md) for a full overview, scientific background, and project roadmap.
    *   Explore the [System Architecture](docs/architecture.md) for a detailed breakdown of modules, components, interfaces, and TRL levels.
3.  **Install Recommended Tools**:
    *   A good Markdown editor (e.g., VSCode with Markdown extensions, Typora, Obsidian) for viewing and editing `.md` files.
    *   (Optional, for later) A LaTeX distribution (e.g., TeXLive, MiKTeX) if you plan to work with or compile LaTeX documents.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to the Biocybernetic Nanoneural Skin project!

*   **Issues & Roadmap**: Check the [GitHub Issues tab](https://github.com/Personaz1/biocybernetic-skin/issues) for a list of open tasks, bugs, and feature requests. The [GitHub Projects board](https://github.com/Personaz1/biocybernetic-skin/projects) (if active) will provide a higher-level view of the project roadmap and progress through different phases.
*   **Reporting Bugs or Suggesting Features**: Please open a new issue, providing as much detail as possible. Use appropriate labels (e.g., `bug`, `enhancement`, `documentation`, `research`, `hardware`, `software`).
*   **Pull Requests**:
    1.  Fork the repository.
    2.  Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix (e.g., `feature/my-new-feature` or `fix/issue-123`).
    3.  Make your changes and commit them with clear, descriptive messages.
    4.  Push your branch to your fork.
    5.  Open a Pull Request (PR) against the `master` branch of this repository.
    6.  Ensure your PR description clearly explains the changes and why they are needed.
    7.  (Once CI is set up) Ensure all CI checks pass.
